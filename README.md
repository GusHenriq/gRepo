## Setting Up Development Environment
Setting up a devlopment environment for Django is intentionally desinged to be simple. There are different configurations you can make to your development environment such as setting up a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). In this setup everything will be installed globally. 

**IDE**

For developing a Django project, no special tools are necessary, since the source code can be edited with any conventional text editor. Nevertheless, editors specialized on   computer programming can help increase the productivity of development, e.g., with features such as syntax highlighting. Since Django is written in Python, text editors       which are aware of Python syntax are beneficial in this regard.

Integrated development environments (IDE) add further functionality, such as debugging, refactoring, and unit testing. As with plain editors, IDEs with support for Python can be beneficial. Some IDEs that are specialized on Python additionally have integrated support for Django projects, so that using such an IDE when developing a Django project can help further increase productivity. 

Choose your preferred IDE. Visual Studio Code, PyCharm and Sublime are all popular options. 

**Installing Python**

If it is not already on your machine. Download and install Python from [Python's Offical Website](https://www.python.org/). 

Ensure that you have it downloaded correctly by running the command `python --version` in your command prompt.

**Installing Django**

Django can be easily installed using pip, Python's included package manager. 

Run the command `pip install Django` in your command prompt. 

Ensure it is downloaded correctly by running the command 'python -m django --version' in your command prompt.

**Cloning This Repository Locally**

Follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) official GitHub tutorial on repository cloning. 

After the repository is cloned locally on your machine, open it using your IDE of choice from step 1.
